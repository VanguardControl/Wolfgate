# The Ashfall Reaver campaign

A round-long, automated threat that scales with time and with the sector danger vote, that every player can see on
the sector map and fight. Built on `_WF/SectorControl` (territory, activity, drawing) and `_WF/Encounters` (ships,
crews, zones, markers, rewards). Rounds run about six hours; every number below is tuned to that.

## Why

Today the Reavers are a dice roll: the storyteller starts a raider pack now and then, it is fought or it jumps out,
and nothing carries over. Nobody can look at the map and say "the pirates are over there, and they are getting
bolder". This gives them ground: strongholds that hold space, patrols that fly it, raids that leave it, and a threat
level that rises while nobody stops them and falls when crews do.

## Strongholds

A stronghold is an encounter (`start: Manual`, `lifetime: Persistent`, never pinned) holding station at a cell
centre. Three prototypes, picked by tier and population:

| | lead | guards | crew | when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WFReaverStrongholdLight` | Kalisto, Metis | 1 × Kalisto, Metis | 3 hands, 2 guards | tier ≤ 2 or under 12 players |
| `WFReaverStrongholdMid` | Fenrir, Garm | 2 × Kalisto, Metis, Bastion | 4 hands, 3 guards | tier 3 |
| `WFReaverStrongholdHeavy` | Saintie, Vulture, Ganymede | 2 × Fenrir, Garm | 4 hands, 4 guards | tier ≥ 4 and 15+ players |

The lead holds; the guards fly `Circle` on the lead's key. Only the lead carries zones (warn 1500 m, attack 900 m,
`wf-encounter-pirate-zone` lines, `disengage: Deter` at 1200 m); the guards have none and fight whoever attacks. The
encounter has `leash: 2000` so nobody chases a hauler across the sector. The lead's hold carries four crates of
`WFManifestContraband`: loot for whoever boards and wins. `icon: Flag`; `company: WFAshfallReavers`, `faction:
PirateNF`, profile `WFCrewProfilePirate`, `distress: false`.

Founding claims the cell and its ring with the encounter entity as the source. A stronghold is **broken** when its
lead is out of the fight (`WFEncounterSystem.InFight` false): the campaign calls `Resolve(Destroyed)` itself, since
the Encounters judge waits for every ship. On `WFEncounterResolvedEvent` with `Destroyed` the campaign pays the
bounty, releases the source (freeing every cell it alone supported) and announces. `Ended` (admin or round end) frees
and pays nothing.

**First stronghold.** `firstStrongholdDelay` after `StationsGeneratedEvent`, once the round is in progress, in a
quiet cell 14–24 km from the origin with a clear centre (`WFEncounterSchedulerSystem.IsClearSpace` with 600 m grid
clearance and 6 km station clearance, which also keeps off hidden stations and gravity wells), at least 8 km from any
living player. **Later strongholds.** When held cells ≥ `cellsPerStronghold` × strongholds, `foundInterval` has
passed since the last founding and the count is under `maxStrongholds`: in a held frontier cell at least two cells
from every stronghold, nearer the core preferred, with a clear centre. **Regroup.** With no stronghold standing for
`regroupDelay`, found a fresh light one as the first was, and announce the regrouping, so breaking the only stronghold
buys a real lull instead of ending the arc.

## Spread

Every `spreadInterval` the campaign claims one frontier cell: unowned, adjacent to a held cell, within
`supportRange` rings of a stronghold (which becomes its source), quiet for `quietMinutes`, and not vetoed. The pick is
weighted toward the origin, so the front creeps inward. A frontier cell that holds a station is not claimed at once:
it is **contested** with a 10 min deadline and announced as a blockade warning naming the station; the framework
claims it at the deadline only if the cell stayed quiet. A Reaver-held station is cut off from NPC freight
(`blockades: true` on the faction) and is a raid target.

## Patrols

Each stronghold keeps up to `patrols[tier]` packs out, under a campaign cap of `clamp(players / 5, 1, 6)` packs.
`WFReaverPatrol`: lead Kalisto, Metis, Bastion or Garm with a pilot, gunner, captain and two hands; wing Carrion,
Hazel, Horsefly or Tick with a pilot and gunner on `Escort`. Transient, off budget, no leash, warn 900 m, attack
450 m, `disengage: Deter` 1200 m, `icon: Skull`. Spawned at a clear point 600–1000 m from its stronghold, then given
its route with `WFEncounterSystem.SetOrders`: `GoTo` (range 200) three to five held-cell centres as a random walk
through held space, each checked clear (a point that is not is nudged or skipped), then `GoTo` home. Home with the
route flown, it resolves `Completed`, jumps out and is swept; the stronghold sends another after `patrolInterval`.

**Patrol killed.** When a patrol resolves `Destroyed`, the cell its lead died in is freed unless a stronghold stands
in it, the patrol bounty is paid, and the sector watch says so without a chime ("Reaver patrol destroyed at K-7, the
cell is clear, bounty paid"). **Stronghold under attack.** Once a stronghold has taken hits from player ships, the
nearest patrol within one cell is recalled to it (`SetOrders`: `GoTo` the stronghold at 600 m).

## Raids

One campaign-wide raid clock from tier 3, interval `raidInterval[tier]` divided by nothing (not per stronghold),
concurrency capped at `clamp(players / 8, 1, 4)`, skipped when nothing qualifies. Targets come from activity data: a
crewed player ship in or beside held space, not docked, not raided in the last 45 min, weighted by crew count; every
third raid targets instead the nearest non-protected station to held space (a core station from tier 4), where the
navies' persistent patrols meet it. Three prototypes: `WFReaverRaidPack` (raider + wing, orders `GoTo` the target at
600 m then `Attack` it), `WFReaverRaidBoarders` (`hunt: true`, as the storyteller's boarders) and
`WFReaverRaidStation` (raider + wing, `GoTo` the station standoff, `wander: 4` there). Launched from the stronghold
nearest the target; the target ship's PA and the common channel get a warning with bearing and distance. The
storyteller's own raiders keep spawning everywhere: the campaign answers `WFEncounterWeightEvent` and scales the
weight of `WFEncounterPirateRaiders` and `WFEncounterPirateBoarders` by `threatScale[tier]`, capped at 1.5.

## Threat

Score = strongholds × 10 + held cells + 20 × (1 − distance of the nearest held cell to the origin / 27 000). Tier
thresholds are the campaign's (`tierThresholds`, five numbers). Tier names: None, Scattered, Organised, Entrenched,
Dominant, Overrun. A rise is announced at once; a fall only after the score has stayed under the threshold for 10
min, and never within 10 min of the last tier announcement. The announcement comes from the sector watch
(`wf-reaver-watch`), with `/Audio/Misc/redalert.ogg` and a red colour rising, `/Audio/Misc/notice1.ogg` and a teal
colour falling, and names the tier, the strongholds and cells held and the current stronghold bounty. Founding,
breaking and regrouping are announced the same way with the cell callsign and the bearing and range from the nearest
station. The legend line sent to the framework reads "Ashfall Reavers: Entrenched, 3 strongholds, 21 cells, bounty
180,000".

## Rewards

`WFEncounterRewardSystem.PayBounty(encounter, reward, deed, supporters)` pays everyone who hit the encounter's ships
(`MinimumHits` across all sides, alive, not of the losers' company) a share of the spesos, split first per ship then
per head, under the hourly cap, with each navy's own faction credits (the campaign's `credits` list: one credit entity,
companies and stronghold and patrol amounts per navy; the first grant rides on the main reward and the rest as
`extraCredits`, rewards of no spesos); and pays a
20 % support pool to the supporters: crewed player ships that spent 90 s within 2500 m of the stronghold while it was
under attack, meaning within two minutes of the last hit on it, without hitting it (medics, tenders, scouts). The
campaign tracks supporters on `WFReaverStrongholdComponent`. `PayBounty` returns how many players were paid; the
announcement says the bounty was paid only when it is above zero. Stronghold bounty: `strongholdBounty[tier]` (Standard 60k, 90k, 120k, 160k, 200k,
250k); patrol bounty `patrolBounty` (20k). Paid on `Destroyed` only.

## The vote

The lobby's sector danger vote picks the campaign: each `wfReaverCampaign` names the `wfEncounterPreset` it serves.
The campaign runs only when `wf.encounters.enabled`, `wf.sector.enabled` and `wf.reavers.enabled` are all on; a
preset with no campaign runs none (logged once).

| | Quiet | Standard | Dangerous |
|---|---|---|---|
| firstStrongholdDelay | 60 min | 25 min | 20 min |
| regroupDelay | 45 min | 30 min | 20 min |
| spreadInterval | 20 min | 12 min | 7 min |
| quietMinutes | 15 | 10 | 6 |
| foundInterval | 90 min | 60 min | 40 min |
| cellsPerStronghold | 8 | 7 | 6 |
| maxStrongholds | 2 | 4 | 5 |
| supportRange | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| patrols by tier (0–5) | 0,1,1,1,1,2 | 0,1,1,2,2,2 | 0,1,2,2,3,3 |
| patrolInterval | 15 min | 10 min | 7 min |
| raidInterval by tier (3–5) | 60, 50, 40 min | 40, 32, 26 min | 30, 24, 18 min |
| threatScale by tier | 1,1,1,1.1,1.2,1.3 | 1,1,1.1,1.2,1.35,1.5 | 1,1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5 |
| tierThresholds | 10,22,40,60,80 | 12,30,55,80,105 | 15,35,60,90,120 |

Standard, unopposed: Scattered at the first founding (25 min), Organised about 2.5 h, Entrenched about 3.5 h,
Dominant near the fifth hour, the front in the inner ring by the end. Any crew can set that back at any time.

## Everyone can take part

- Guns: hunt patrols (frees a cell at once, paid), break strongholds (collapses a region, paid, loot aboard).
- No guns: fly a lane to keep it quiet (a blockade counts moving ships only, so docking or loitering does not stop it);
  stand by an assault for the support pool; haul and salvage.
- Navies: the Halcyon's cell is never taken, but a front at the doorstep is theirs, and each navy's faction credits
  (TSF and PDV alike) flow through the bounty.
- Ghosts: strongholds, patrols and raids on the Encounters tab of the orbit menu as any encounter.
- Admins: `wf_reavers status | found [x y] | tier <n> | spread | patrol | raid | pause | resume | clear`, and every
  campaign encounter in the Encounters admin window.
- Round end: a summary line (peak cells held, strongholds founded and broken, patrols destroyed) through
  `RoundEndTextAppendEvent`.

## Module layout (`ReaverCampaign`)

- `Content.Shared/_WF/ReaverCampaign`: `WFReaverCampaignPrototype.cs` (`wfReaverCampaign`: `preset`, every number
  above, the prototype ids, bounties, sounds and colours), `ReaverCampaignCVars.cs` (`wf.reavers.enabled`).
- `Content.Server/_WF/ReaverCampaign`: `README.md`, `Components/WFReaverStrongholdComponent.cs` (cell, tier at
  founding, hits seen, supporters), `Components/WFReaverPatrolComponent.cs` (stronghold, route),
  `Components/WFReaverRaidComponent.cs` (target), `Components/WFReaverCampaignComponent.cs` (campaign state on the
  sector map entity: tier, score, clocks, counters for the round summary), `Systems/WFReaverCampaignSystem.cs` with
  partials `.Strongholds.cs`, `.Spread.cs`, `.Patrols.cs`, `.Raids.cs`, `.Threat.cs`, `.Announce.cs`, `.Rewards.cs`,
  `Commands/WFReaverCommand.cs`.
- `Resources/Prototypes/_WF/ReaverCampaign/campaigns.yml`, `encounters.yml`; `Resources/Locale/en-US/_WF/ReaverCampaign/reavers.ftl`;
  `Resources/ServerInfo/_WF/ReaverCampaign/Reavers.xml` guidebook page if the guidebook takes module pages without
  an upstream edit (follow an existing `_WF` guidebook page; otherwise leave it out and say so).
- Tests: `Content.IntegrationTests/Tests/_WF/ReaverCampaign/` (founding claims ring, lead down breaks and pays,
  patrol kill frees a cell, spread respects quiet and veto, contest claims at deadline, tier rises and falls with
  hysteresis, regroup, every votable preset has exactly one campaign). Every step is a one-shot method the test can
  call (`TryFound`, `TrySpreadOnce`, `TryLaunchPatrol`, `TryLaunchRaid`, `SetTier`), with time from `IGameTiming`.

Edits inside `_WF/Encounters` (same fork, no markers; the README overview gains a paragraph): `TrySpawn(...,
bool offBudget = false)`; public `SetOrders(encounter, key, queue)` that sets `HasOrders`/`Flown`; public
`PayBounty` in the reward system with the helper selection pulled out of `OnResolved`; `WFEncounterWeightEvent`
(by ref) raised in the scheduler's `Pick` at the weight line; public `IsClearSpace(map, point, gridClearance,
stationClearance)` and `Stations(map)` on the scheduler.

## Decisions

- Strongholds are encounters, not stations: crews, zones, markers, the admin window, the ghost menu and cleanup
  come for free, and no map file is needed.
- Lead down is broken. The judge waits for the guards; the campaign does not.
- Killing a patrol frees its cell at once. Slow decay would hide the feedback.
- One raid clock for the campaign, capped by population. Per-stronghold clocks reached 36 raids an hour.
- Light garrisons first. A pirate frigate at minute 20 on a ten-player round is not a fight, it is a wall.
- Only tiers, strongholds and patrol kills are announced. Cell churn shows on the map.

## Later

- A medevac tender beside a stronghold under assault (`WFEncounterMedicTrader` via `TryStartAt`).
- A broken stronghold's lead as a claimable hulk (the derelict machinery).
- Relief freight to a liberated station; a traffic boost at low tiers.
- A Wolfgate admin-tab window for the campaign.
- Storyteller raider placement restricted to held and adjacent cells.
