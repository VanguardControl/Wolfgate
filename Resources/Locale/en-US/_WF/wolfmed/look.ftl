# LOOK: the health examine read as a visual inspection. Every string here is something an examiner could
# see on the body in front of them; numbers, rates and severities stay on the health analyzer.
#
# LOOK2: the examine draws a row per damaged part, so every finding has two strings: the sentence below,
# which is its tooltip and its plain-text line, and a `-short` label of two to four words for the row
# itself. The wound data names the short one, the findings the system builds itself find it by suffix.
