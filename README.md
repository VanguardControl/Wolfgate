Wolfgate is a fork of [Monolith](https://github.com/Monolith-Station/Monolith), itself a fork of [Frontier Station 14](https://github.com/new-frontiers-14/frontier-station-14), running on the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Wolfgate.

If you want to host or create content for Wolfgate, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Wolfgate-specific code lives in `_WF` folders, and edits to upstream files are marked with `// WOLFGATE` comments so they are easy to find when merging from Monolith.

We are not accepting translations on this repository.

## Building

Refer to [the Space Wizards' guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/setting-up-a-development-environment.html) for setting up a development environment. Most of it applies, but Wolfgate is not upstream Space Station 14, so some details differ.
