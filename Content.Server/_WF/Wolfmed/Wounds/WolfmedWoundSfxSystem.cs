/// <summary>
/// The noise and the mess a wound makes (V1/V4). A wound that lands, or jumps a stage, plays a sound keyed
/// by what it is and what it is in; a hit throws blood or sparks off the body. Both are read from
/// <see cref="WolfmedSfxProfilePrototype"/>, both are throttled per body, and both are silent unless the
/// wound moved because something hit the body.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Server-side because wound creation is. Sounds play at the BODY: a wound lives in the part's container
/// and a part lives in nullspace, so neither has a position to play from. The damage gate is what keeps
/// an infection, a necrosis clock or a healing tick from making a sound; it is stamped by
/// <see cref="WolfmedPartDamageEvent"/>, which is raised inside the same tick as the wound it causes.
/// FIX1: blood is thrown by the hit raising the body's bleeding, not by the wound's category or severity,
/// so a blunt hit that opens a bleed sprays and a cut that clots on contact does not. A chassis has no
/// bleeding to read, so its sparks still come straight off the wound.
