# Cockpit

Optional fullscreen flight deck for the shuttle console. Enter Cockpit requires piloting that console
while buckled into any seat on the same grid. Unbuckling, losing piloting, closing the BUI,
changing character or leaving gameplay restores the normal HUD. The existing server-side permissions
still govern every flight, camera, access and shield request; cockpit mode only changes presentation.
Entry selects EXT while preserving zoom and low-light settings; leaving restores that pilot's prior camera.
Cockpit camera changes never overwrite the console's shared saved settings, so overlapping pilots and
ordinary console users retain their own choices. The other camera views remain available. In the External
view, a right click that does not move opens the entity menu on release, and dragging with the right button pans.
Live pressure, internals and buckle alerts, votes, and speech bubbles remain available around the world
view. Character hotkeys, inventory controls and the menu bar remain hidden; Escape closes other windows
or opens the game menu without closing the cockpit helm.

The header centers the existing Wolfgate wordmark between the title and exit control.
Flight instruments, compact camera controls and propulsion occupy the left column, with motion gauges
above the central world viewport and communications and shield controls below it. The velocity dial shows
actual drift relative to the bow, with forward at the top and starboard on the right, alongside total speed.
Its direction pointer uses a fixed square-root response against a 100 m/s full scale, making low-speed drift
more visible without scale jumps, and disappears when nearly stationary.
A horizontal fuel gauge below HULL shares its row with a FUEL LOW lamp and stays fixed outside the dial scroller.
The instrument housing uses compact padding and gaps while preserving dial sizes. HULL remains the final
scrolling strip above fuel on short screens. The velocity dial retains the speed readout. The MFD fills the right column. Its maps use
right-mouse panning and compact department labels, with scrolling details kept separate from the larger plots. Numbered approach markers link to readable port actions below the plot.
Shield arc width stays in the permanent shield control panel. Digital and mechanical instruments share the same large dial footprint, and the
lower flight bank aligns with communications and shields. Its six status lamps show live autopilot, FTL,
dampener, parking, docking and shield state; autopilot activity is replicated independently of MFD selection.
Retro lamps use recessed glass lenses and metal sockets; Futurist lamps use illuminated traces and light strips.
A permanent TCAS bank below the instruments has CAUTION and WARNING lamps above OK and FAULT lamps.
Caution flashes slowly; warning flashes quickly while caution keeps its slow rhythm. OK lights steadily
when clear, and FAULT lights when TCAS is off or telemetry is unavailable. The bank remains visible while
using guns, with impact countdown, bearing, closing speed and full threat details on hover.
The speed limiter lives on SYS; flight controls retain dampeners and orbit controls.
The MFD holds navigation, hull overlays, strategic travel, docking, access, shield details and auxiliary
systems. A wide SHP display gives half its width to the hull plot, with two columns of gauges beside it.
Damage, fire, pressure and power overlays share one row, with department labels and hull fitting below.
Compact MFDs retain the vertical layout with independently scrolling details. ACCESS keeps its framed door map
as the largest panel, beside the controls when there is room and above them in compact layouts. Its
details use one scroller without nested scrolling lists, and the bezel matches the selected
Wolfgate theme. Exit restores the same controls and chat draft without reopening
interfaces or changing the player's display settings. Expand is unavailable when the window is too narrow to
widen the MFD, and the dials switch to compact faces on short windows (under about 1000 px of height). The
docking page has a Recenter plot button. The planet timepiece panel is hidden while the cockpit is open, and
replay viewers cannot enter it.

A seated pilot can also link to an accessible, powered gunnery console within normal interaction reach
on the same ship. The nearest eligible console is chosen and retained while usable. FLIGHT/GUNS
switches the left column between flight instruments and the shared paginated weapon bank, including
selection, saved groups and compact countermeasures. Weapon rows retain readable text and slim supply
bars; page changes preserve the full selection for firing and group saves. Left-click or hold over the world viewport or NAV plot fires the
selected weapons on either tab; moving the pointer updates guided-missile aim, and right mouse still pans. A native aiming reticle
replaces the pointer over valid world and NAV targets while offensive weapons are selected, independently
of character combat mode. HUD controls, chat, modifiers, lost focus and an unarmed bank retain ordinary
cursors and mouse interactions. The cockpit holds gun control while GUNS is open or any weapon is selected,
so weapons selected on GUNS stay armed when the pilot returns to FLIGHT to fly and shoot; the click is
consumed by firing there. With nothing selected, FLIGHT releases gun control and keeps the normal pointer
and clicks. A lost link clears the selection and releases control at once; a changed link does the same unless GUNS is open.
Exiting or losing pilot eligibility releases the link and all input hooks. Reach follows normal body-fixture distance and obstruction checks,
independent of the camera. Nearby unopened consoles discover their gun server when acquired. Temporary
gunnery power or access loss clears the weapon link; restoring it reconnects without leaving cockpit mode.
Loss of helm power ends piloting and exits the cockpit.

Commands travel through the existing helm BUI, with seat, reach, power, access and weapon ownership
checked by the server for each request. They reuse native firing, group and flare handlers; no second
gunnery window is opened. Discovery without gun control only supplies telemetry; NPC gunners recognize the pilot as
a human console operator only while the pilot holds gun control (GUNS open or weapons selected). The cockpit link does not apply the crewed-shuttle
rule that blocks a player from holding the helm and gunnery windows together, so one seated pilot can fly and
fire a crewed ship from the cockpit.

Entry points: `WFCockpitUIController`, `WFCockpitView`, `WFCockpitLease` and the console partials.
`WFCockpitGunnerySystem` owns authorized gun links; `WFCockpitGunneryPanel` and `WFCockpitFireInput`
provide the embedded controls and aiming. `WFCockpitSeatComponent` is inherited by seats; `SharedWFCockpitSystem` checks replicated eligibility.

- [`Content.Client/UserInterface/Systems/Chat/Widgets/ResizableChatBox.cs`](../../../Content.Client/UserInterface/Systems/Chat/Widgets/ResizableChatBox.cs)
  - the cockpit controls chat sizing.
  - preserve the normal chat margins while docked.
- [`Content.Client/UserInterface/Systems/CloseWindow/CloseRecentWindowUIController.cs`](../../../Content.Client/UserInterface/Systems/CloseWindow/CloseRecentWindowUIController.cs): Escape must not close the hidden helm that supplies the cockpit.
- [`Content.Server/Shuttles/Systems/ShuttleConsoleSystem.cs`](../../Shuttles/Systems/ShuttleConsoleSystem.cs)
  - report confirmed steering in the initial helm snapshot.
  - keep autopilot lamps current while any helm page is open.
- [`Content.Shared/Shuttles/BUIStates/ShuttleBoundUserInterfaceState.cs`](../../../Content.Shared/Shuttles/BUIStates/ShuttleBoundUserInterfaceState.cs): include confirmed autopilot activity in the initial helm state.
- [`Resources/Prototypes/Entities/Structures/Furniture/chairs.yml`](../../../Resources/Prototypes/Entities/Structures/Furniture/chairs.yml): allow every seat family to host the buckled piloting HUD.
