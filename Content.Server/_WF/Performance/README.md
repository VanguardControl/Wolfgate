# Performance

Small fixes for hot spots found in live server profiles, kept as narrow hooks into upstream systems.

- `WFCollectionExtensions.ClearAndTrim` clears a reused scratch set and frees its storage after a crowded query, so
  atmos and mover lookups don't keep paying for one huge pile of items.
- `SharedGravitySystem.WFRefresh` batches weightlessness refreshes for half a second after a grid's gravity changes and
  walks only that grid's entities, instead of every gravity-affected entity on the server per change.
- `PathfindingSystem` skips mining rock grids (`WFAsteroidGridComponent`). Building their nav chunks cost about 2.6 ms
  per new rock grid, nearly all the cost of a field loading in, and no NPC walks on one.
- `DockingSystem.WFPlacement` speeds up the dock search a ship purchase or FTL dock runs: pairs of docks that would put
  the ship somewhere else are ruled out before the tile check rather than after it, and the tile check skips the
  station's empty chunks. It picks the same dock as before; a six-dock ship at a 77-dock station went from seconds to
  about 60 ms.
- Worldgen churn: a space chunk stays loaded for `wf.worldgen.unload_grace` seconds (60) after nothing needs it
  (`WorldControllerSystem.WFUnloadGrace`), and a GC queue's `minAge` holds entities that long before deleting them
  (`GCQueueSystem.WFMinAge`; `WFAsteroids` waits 60 s). A ship that comes back within the grace keeps the asteroid
  fields around it instead of unloading and respawning them.
- `WFAsteroidCullSystem` stops sending every worldgen rock grid to every player. A player is sent a rock grid once one
  of their views comes within `wf.asteroids.send_range` (128 m) and keeps it until the rock is deleted, since the
  client can't detach a grid. Each worldgen chunk with rocks gets a field entity (`WFAsteroidFieldComponent`), sent to
  everyone, listing its rocks' position, rotation and look; on the client `WFAsteroidFieldSystem` reads it so radar
  (`ShuttleNavControl.WFAsteroidFields`) and the far overlay draw rocks whose grids haven't been sent. Rocks no chunk
  owns are sent to everyone as before, `ChunkingSystem` skips rock grids (they hold no decals or gas), and
  `wf.asteroids.cull false` turns it all off live.
- Roofs network as chunk deltas (`SharedRoofSystem.WFDelta`). Maps go to every player, and a cavern map's full roof
  is tens of kilobytes; each tile change on the surface above resent all of it, which emptied clients' state buffers.
  A delta carries only the chunks changed since the client's last ack.
- A drydock break lifts its finished tiles together every 10 s (`WFDrydockJobComponent.Lifting`) instead of one at a
  time, since each lift resends every fixture of the hull (about 9 KB on a derelict, 50 KB on a big ship) to every player.
- The client Z-level sprite passes (`CEClientZLevelsPreAnimSystem`, `CEClientZLevelsPostAnimSystem`) walk only
  entities off the ground or just landed (`CESharedZLevelsSystem.WFRaised`), instead of every entity with Z physics.
  The full walk over about 52,000 entities took 38% of a live client's game thread. A height joins the list from
  server state, prediction or `SetZPosition`, so raise an entity through those rather than writing `LocalPosition`.
- Nav map deltas (`NavMapComponent.WFDelta`) name the chunks removed since the client's ack instead of listing every
  chunk on the grid, which cost about 30 KB per update on a planet map. The history keeps the newest removals
  (`NavMapSystem.WFRemoved`), and a client behind what it dropped gets a full state.
- A ship sale serialises the hull on the main thread as before, but writes its YAML text on a worker
  (`ShipyardSystem.TrySaveShipDeferred`). That takes about a quarter off the hitch of each sale; serialising is the rest.
- One-second jobs take a tick each instead of landing together (`WFTickSpread`): radius heaters and drains. Wound
  overlay refreshes take a share per tick, and fixture damage and the atmos alerts console start on their own offsets.
  Radius heaters also look only for loose things to warm, not anchored or stored ones.
- `IgnitionSourceSystem` walks only lit sources (`WFLit`), and a ship's shield follows it with one transform call.
- More one-second jobs stop landing on one tick: Wolfmed body ticks are spread with `WFTickSpread`, and encounter
  zones, ship status, crew ship status, cargo load and thermal signatures each start on their own part of the second.
- AI ship steering works every other tick and holds its input between (`ShipSteeringSystem`), and `FlammableSystem`
  looks for what's due every third tick.
- `WFGridDeleteWatchSystem` logs any grid that takes at least 50 ms to delete, by name and entity count.
- The marked upstream edits skip idle-shuttle thruster work, avoid `Enum.GetValues` and nullable boxing on per-tick
  paths, stop `FlammableSystem` from crashing when igniting queues new fire events, and stop networking a thrown
  item's shooter (it outlived the shooter and sent a deleted entity every state).
