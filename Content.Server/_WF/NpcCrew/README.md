# NpcCrew

Crew Setup has a four-step creation flow (ship, roster, rules, review) and an active-crew sidebar. Ship, vessel and
equipment lists are searchable; post coordinates and equipment overrides expand per member. Selecting a live crew
opens its mission queue, settings and separate admin tools. Add-to-end preserves progress; explicitly editing a
draft enables reorder/remove/replace. Each crew keeps its draft across selection and automatic refresh. Refreshes
preserve dropdown buttons, filters and unfinished clicks; polling runs on display frames rather than prediction
replays. Security settings can be changed without replacing the queue;
unauthorized boarding and docking independently support Ignore, Warn and Hostile. Authorization uses company
membership where available, otherwise a shared NPC faction. A crew's ordered docking destination is authorized
for that approach. Incoming ships do not cause the stationary crew to announce that it is docking. Radio officers
announce their own approach and completed docking, and warn unauthorized arrivals.

An engineer (`WFCrewEngineer`) is posted beside the plant on every encounter ship whose roles allow one. The ship
arrives commissioned (generators full and lit, reactor jarred and injecting, batteries charged) with fuel for the trip
stowed in a `WFCrewFuelStores` crate in the hold. From then on nothing tops the plant up but him: a generator under
ten units of fuel or a reactor jar under 200 sends him to the crate for a stack or a jar, which he feeds in by hand,
and a plant with fuel in it that is off he switches on. No stores, or no living engineer, and the ship goes dark; a
ship stranded for fuel gets neither. A fighter whose roles leave no room for an engineer tops its own generators up
whenever they run low, as long as any of its crew live.

A Warn crew gives a stranger it notices aboard `WarnTime` (30 s) to leave; if he stays, or strikes any crewman, the
crew's fighters (on-sight crew, marines, the captain and radio officer; not the helm or the guns) take him on as
their own attacker, by the usual rules: in sight, and one man hunting him unseen. A when-attacked hand answers only
his own attacker, and an attacker is remembered while he is aboard and seen or reported, then for 30 s more. Only a
blow to a crewman himself sends him straight after someone he cannot see. Crew who never fight, including the
cowards a profile's `cowards` chance makes (half the hauler deckhands), drop their work, run for the bridge and lie
on the deck there until the alarm is over. Off their post's grid crew answer an attacker in sight only when sent
there, on a job or a raid, or when he is their faction's enemy anyway (a raider carried off); a crewman who only
defends his ship goes home. Crew never show the SSD sleep icon.

Foot boarders must be seen within normal sight range through an unobstructed view before security reacts.
Personal AI devices, loose silicon brains and station AI cores/remote eyes are equipment, not boarders; physical
cyborg chassis and hostile NPC bodies still qualify. Crew relay sightings through their equipped Shortband
headsets; switched-off, removed or blocked radios do not share
contacts. Boarding alerts go to both the local and alert channels. Action chatter has a fifteen-second speaker
cooldown and a one-minute repeat cooldown. Deckhands and marines select safe deck patrol stops 45–90 seconds
apart; other roles keep their stations. Pilots and gunners maintain their facing toward occupied consoles.
Pilots, gunners, captains and radio officers defend themselves only against personal attackers, even when their
engagement rule is On Sight. They actively return after displacement or combat; pilots retain their assigned helm.
Injury and casualty reports require a witness or working headset reception on the same ship.

Crew use their equipped ammunition and weapons, then unarmed combat, without scavenging empty loose guns.
They stop pursuing hostiles that leave their ship. Assigned supply/salvage trips remain allowed, and displaced
crew return home when work ends. Departure waits for living autonomous crew to return aboard, then releases
the docks and backs clear before resuming the next flight order. Long docking approaches face the flight path;
the final docking corridor still uses the required port alignment and may involve lateral thrust.

Escort Grid assigns separate staggered formation slots behind and beside the leader, with spacing enlarged for
hull clearance. Slots move and rotate with the leader, and escorts match its heading. Captain reactions preserve
the slot when resuming an interrupted escort. Connected escorts and their protected ships share incoming hull
and shield attacks across crew groups and companies. This includes an uncrewed protected freighter and chained
escorts; temporary evasion and losing a captain or pilot do not break the assignment while other crew survive.
Explicit replacement orders, pausing, skipping or cancelling the escort end its membership. Formation ships
are excluded from gunner targets and protected from crew cannon fire, including shield capacity. Follow Grid remains the simpler
proximity-following order and does not join this defensive alliance. Weapon locks alone do not trigger hostility.

Circle Grid slowly orbits the destination's bounds center. Default cruise, circle and attack limits are 10, 4 and
6 m/s; attack defaults to at least 350 m. Pilots use gentle thrust and turning, full braking, hull clearance and
stopping distance. Hold retains a fixed anchor and brakes small drift instead of continually steering around it.
Flight tuning in creation/live settings exposes 37 speed, handling, clearance and docking values. Reusable
`wfCrewNavigation` profiles supply scenario defaults; each mission gets an independent copy. Changes apply to
the current pilot without restarting the queue. See `Docs/_WF/NpcCrew/navigation.md` for scenario configuration.

Autonomous crew projectiles pass through allies; allied damage is also stopped before wound routing, armor or
retaliation. Crews holster when no living hostile remains. Forward travel faces the destination, and pilots face
their console when taking the helm. Spawned crew register ordinary, revocable ID credentials even on map-loaded
ships that do not yet have ship access management.
Crew-operated cannon rounds also protect allies and allied hulls, retaining their firing origin after a gunner dies
or a player takes over. Explicit Attack orders, incoming fire and hostile docking permit retaliation against
the targeted ship, including a normally friendly company; escorts in the same formation remain protected.

Repair orders assign deckhands physical work through HTN navigation. Deckhands have a built-in unlimited SRD and
repair tool, disabled permanently on death; no unlimited item drops. The ship's existing SRD snapshot is preserved,
or initialized when its first crew member spawns. Repair restores missing snapshot tiles/structures and uses normal
timed repairs for repairable equipment. Resupply docks and retrieves loose ammunition and filled oxygen tanks;
Salvage docks and retrieves loose material stacks. Workers carry cargo back to their posts. Neither job fabricates
supplies, opens containers or dismantles structures. Workers bound for a docked grid walk to their own port, step
across and path on the other grid, and back the same way. Nothing is picked that has no clear deck beside it, and a
worker who gets no nearer for ten seconds (a railing in the way, or no path) gives that target up for the next.
Unreachable work times out visibly and can be retried with pause/resume. These jobs require a deckhand, a pilot for the objective queue, and suitable EVA equipment.
Repair skips snapshot entries their SRD cannot rebuild, respecting prototype and grid restrictions and tool modes.

Default crew loadouts include pressure suits, helmets, masks and finite oxygen tanks. Internals connect before
work and in unsafe air. Below the reserve threshold, crew replace the tank from a reachable loose spare or leave
work for safe air; once safe they can seek a filled tank on their home ship. Oxygen is not replenished magically.
Custom loadouts without suitable protection or air cannot start work orders.

Crew Setup also lists active crews and their remaining objectives, refreshing every two seconds. Select a crew
and build a queue of Hold, GoTo coordinates (repeat for patrol waypoints), Dock, Undock, Loiter or Circle at a grid, Escort,
Attack or Retreat to a grid. Append preserves the running task; Replace starts the edited queue from its first
entry. Edit, move up/down, remove, pause, resume and skip are available. Timed Hold/Loiter/Circle/Follow/Escort/Attack tasks use seconds;
zero means indefinite until skipped. Travel, retreat, dock and undock advance on arrival. Missing targets or a failed
dock pause the queue with a visible status; a replacement pilot can continue it. Immediate orders cancel the queue.
Queues last for the round and are scoped by ship and group. Attack explicitly assigns the gunner's target, including
a normally friendly grid. Incoming attacks temporarily override faction friendship for retaliation; vessel
threats expire after sixty seconds without further attacks.
An explicit hostile-docking response overrides faction friendship for that visitor. Captain interruptions during
automatic departure preserve the intended next order and its destination beyond the temporary undocking maneuver.

Crew AI stays awake away from player bodies (`KeepActive`, default true; opt out in VV for intentionally dormant
crew). Loaded guns close their bolt/chamber a round before fighting, and ammunition checks continue during combat.
Captains evade external ship threats using their profile's attack orbit and restore the interrupted course after all-clear;
onboard-only threats still cause a hold. Pilots use Mono projectile avoidance outside docking.
The final docking approach aligns the ship early and enters the prechecked port corridor without the destination's
collision-avoidance buffer pushing it away. Approach and settle have bounded retries. The physical Dredger/Drillsite
regression uses the real hulls and thrusters, with test power supplied, and never uses FTL.

Human-style NPC crew for ships: each NPC works a job at a post and drops it to fight, then goes back to work. Crew
carry real loadouts and keep the weapon holstered until there is a fight; a dead crewman's kit is the loot. Mappers
place crew with `WFCrewSpawnPoint*` markers; admins use `wf_crew` to plan a grid (`plan here`), spawn the plan
(`spawn here`), spawn one role where they stand (`spawnrole deckhand`), list, clear a group, change a duty, give a
pilot orders (`orders <mob> hold | goto <x> <y> ... | loiter <x> <y> <radius> | follow <grid|here> | dock <grid|here> |
undock`) or set what a radio officer calls the ship (`callsign <mob> <text...>`).

Crew planning and setup spawning require clear flooring with safe pressure, temperature, oxygen and low
contamination. Unsafe marker posts are omitted. Dock and Follow orders expose a Destination grid picker;
select another grid on the same map, then apply orders. Refresh preserves the destination selection.

Spawn `WFMobCrewGunner` from the entity menu for a ready-to-work gunner, or use `wf_crew spawnrole gunner`
to assign crew membership and ship credentials. Crew Setup and gunner markers use the same NPC. It carries
the officer loadout and operates a powered gunnery console against reported hostile ships.

Built so far: the crew core (`WFCrewSystem`, `WFCrewComponent`, the `WFCrewCompound` HTN root with fight, duty and
idle branches), weapons (`WFCrewWeaponSystem` with the draw and holster operators), the planner (`WFCrewPlannerSystem`:
markers win, else a pilot and radio officer beside the helm, a deckhand inside each airlock and the rest on open
deck), role prototypes (`wfCrewRole`) for deckhand, marine, pilot, radio operator, captain and gunner, the pilot duty and the
command. The pilot (`WFPilotDutySystem`, `WFPilotDutyComponent` on every officer) walks to the nearest powered helm,
takes it and flies its orders (Hold, GoTo waypoints, Loiter, Follow, Dock, Undock) with Mono's ship steering; the
orders advance in the system, so the ship keeps flying while the pilot's HTN sleeps, and the helm is let go when he
dies, is taken over, loses the console or leaves for a fight. Dock is flown by hand (`WFPilotDutySystem.Docking.cs`):
plan a free dock pair with a clear approach lane, fly to a standoff 40 m out from the target dock, settle, creep in and
connect the moment the docks line up, retrying up to three times and then holding (`WFPilotDockedEvent`,
`WFPilotDockFailedEvent`); `wf.crew.dock_ftl_fallback` docks by FTL instead of giving up. Undock releases every port
and backs off. The radio officer (`WFRadioOperatorSystem`, `WFRadioOperatorComponent`, added by his role's
`components`) stands guard at his post and reports what happens to his ship as himself: docking, undocking, jumps,
arrival, orders flown or docking aborted on Shortband; a mayday on the first hostile act of an attack (a crewman hurt
from outside the crew, or a hostile mob aboard), the boarding call, the captain or pilot going down and the all-clear
two minutes after the last hostile activity on Broadband (and a faction channel if set). Events only, no sitreps; he
goes quiet when he is down. Crew retaliation catches incoming damage before Wolfmed routes it through body parts, using upstream faction checks
and attack memory so officers fight back when hit. Captains evade external threats or hold for boarders, then resume the remaining
route afterward; newer orders, death, player takeover, or leaving the crew cancel that saved course.
Shared alerts (`WFCrewAlertSystem`) let living on-sight crew aboard the same ship and group share targets once a
second. Awareness expands across the ship until 60 seconds without a target; crew leaving the group or switching
to when-attacked engagement recover their original awareness. `ShareAlerts` on the crew component opts out.
Officers are excluded, and `WFCrewAlertEvent` / `WFCrewAlertClearedEvent` expose transitions for future duties.
Crew use normal access readers before trying to pry a door. On ShipAccess-managed grids, `SpawnCrewman` equips
and registers an ordinary ID card through `WFCrewAccessSystem`; removing the card or revoking its allow-list entry
removes that access. Movement and duty changes never enroll crew on another ship. Unmanaged doors use the crew's
configured access tags and cards. The access-aware steering partial lives in this module, with small marked hooks
in upstream navigation.
Reloading uses real compatible magazines from equipment slots through normal item interaction. Spent guns are
holstered in favor of a loaded sidearm, melee weapon, or empty hands; no ammunition is created.
Hull impacts from another ship's artillery raise crew alerts and a radio mayday through the existing projectile
handler. Gunners walk to an available powered console and use Mono's ship targeting and fire-control path only
against explicitly reported hostile vessels, excluding friendly factions. Console loss, incapacitation, player
takeover, leaving the post, or changing duty stops their targeting.
Admins open Crew Setup from the Wolfgate tab or a crew NPC's admin verb. Choose a ship (or spawn a vessel), plan and
edit posts, roles, loadouts and engagement, then set company, NPC faction, radio channels and pilot orders. Preview
shows posts only to the requesting admin for 30 seconds; clear affects only the selected grid and group.
`WFCrewSetupSystem.TrySpawn` is the validated encounter-facing roster and mission API;
`WFCrewAlertSystem.ReportShipThreat` supplies encounter vessel threats. RES itself remains a separate project.

`design.md` under `Docs/_WF/NpcCrew/` is the full brief: pilot duty and orders, docking by hand, the event-driven
radio officer, crew alerting, the access-door edit and the Crew Setup admin window.

## Local playtesting

Run `Tools/_WF/NpcCrew/Start-TestPair.ps1` from PowerShell to build and open an isolated local pair on port 1221.
Server and Client use sibling directories `bin/NpcCrewPlaytest.Server` and `bin/NpcCrewPlaytest.Client` to preserve
their dependency versions and the engine's development resource paths. `-BuildName` changes their shared prefix.
It uses the optimized `Tools` configuration, preserving admin tools without Debug physics-ray broadcasts, and
disables simulated latency, loss and duplication on both endpoints. Client sandboxing and UI diagnostics remain
enabled; mob pushing is disabled. Logs go to timestamped `wfcrew-playtest-*` files in TEMP. Existing
`TEMP/wfcrew-navigation-server-data` is preserved. Use `-SkipBuild` for matching existing binaries or supply
`-Port` and `-DataDirectory` for a separate session. The launcher refuses occupied ports and live output/data
directories, builds serially, and waits up to 60 seconds for server readiness before opening the client.

Debug ray traffic can delay reliable menu and Ghost Warp replies behind NPC visibility checks while world state
continues updating. A live 2048-ray probe delayed a Ghost Warp reply by 5.37 seconds with simulated networking,
versus about 0.2 seconds with simulation disabled. Longer combat playtesting remains necessary.
