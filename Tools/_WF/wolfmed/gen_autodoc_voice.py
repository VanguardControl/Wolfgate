"""Generates S.A.M.'s voice lines for the autodoc as mono Ogg Vorbis, plus their locale transcripts.

Usage: python Tools/_WF/wolfmed/gen_autodoc_voice.py [--report] [line-id ...]

Naming line ids renders only those; the transcripts and the attributions are always written from the whole
table, so adding a line does not have to re-encode the sixty that were already right.

eSpeak NG speaks each line, ffmpeg converts it to mono Ogg at 32 kbps. LINES is the single source of
truth: the ogg file name, the FTL id, the spoken text and the voice priority all come from one row, so a
transcript can never drift from the audio. SPOKEN overrides what eSpeak says when the written line carries
a Fluent placeholder or punctuation the synthesiser reads badly.

Priorities drive the pod's voice queue. Step lines are one or two words and must stay under 1.2 s, Urgent
under 3 s and Info under 4 s; --report prints every duration so those bounds can be checked here as well as
in WolfmedAutodocTest.
