"""Builds the cavern mouth RSIs: one per world, the crumbling lip of a hole drawn over the hole's own tiles.

A hole in the ground is empty tiles, and the z-level renderer draws the cavern below through them; the lip tiles around
it are solid ground the cavern never shows through. So this art only ever paints the hole's own tiles, and leaves their
middle clear. It is drawn on the dual grid: each piece is centred on a corner of the hole's tiles and covers a quarter
of each of the four tiles around it, painting only the quarters that are hole.

Over those quarters the ground overhangs the opening by a few wandering pixels, in the world's ground texture so it
reads as the lip itself, and ends in a dark broken edge. A hole's corners are rounded off and a corner of ground poking
into the hole gets the lip wrapped round it, so no square corner shows. Inside the opening: a suggestion of shaft wall
under a north rim, a sliver of side wall inside east and west rims and a soft shadow along every rim, all fading out
before the middle of a tile, and the world's own touch hanging off the lip now and then.

States (WFCavernShadeVisualsSystem picks them; the names must match its own):
- `v<mask>_<labels>_<variant>`: `mask` says which of the four tiles are hole (1 NW, 2 NE, 4 SW, 8 SE), 1 to 14; a
  corner with hole all round has no rim and draws nothing. `labels` says, for each piece border the rim crosses (1 top,
  2 right, 4 bottom, 8 left), whether the lip overhangs deep (set) or shallow there. Both pieces on a border see the
  same tile edge, whose label is a stable hash of it, so the rim meets itself there; between borders it wanders freely.
  `variant` is one of `variants(mask)` drawings.
- `pit`: a lone hole tile over black, the placement icon.

Nothing a piece draws near its borders depends on the tiles beyond its own four, so pieces join seamlessly: the rim is
pinned to its label there, every shadow and wall fades out before the middle of a tile, and details keep clear of the
borders.
