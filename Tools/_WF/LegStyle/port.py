"""Ports leg art into the RSIs and base sprites the leg style prototypes point at.

Run from the repository root against a Meridian Rift checkout and a Starlight one:

    python Tools/_WF/LegStyle/port.py --source <Meridian-Rift checkout> --starlight <Starlight checkout>

The furred species wear Starlight's Vulpkanin legs, the others Meridian Rift's.

An SS13 leg is one sprite; here it is a leg and a foot layer, so each is cut at the row the upstream
species cut theirs. Every set is tinted to the species that wears it: its channels are scaled by how that
species' torso compares with the torso the legs were drawn for. Where the species' torso would leave a gap
above the new legs, the hip of the torso they were drawn for fills it, and the species' own leg after that.

Clothing is drawn for plantigrade legs and moved by displacement maps:
- Shoes get a map per paw shape. Row by row, every stretch of digitigrade leg samples the stretch of human
  leg on that row. Starlight's legs fit the shoe map Reptilians use, which Starlight ships too.
- Jumpsuits and outer clothing use the leg rows of the map Reptilians use, mended per paw shape: a leg
  pixel that map would leave bare samples the human body as a shoe does. Starlight's legs take
  Starlight's own outer clothing map instead, mended the same way. A species whose own map also
  reshapes the upper body gets a map with its rows above the hip and those leg rows below, or untouched leg
  rows for a plantigrade option.
