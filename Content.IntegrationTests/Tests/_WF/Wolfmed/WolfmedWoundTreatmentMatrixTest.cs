/// <para>
/// The sibling <see cref="WolfmedTreatmentMatrixTest"/> drives three real heals through the routing system
/// to pin the capability gate itself. This one is the breadth pass over all 44 wounds, so it reads the
/// gate rather than exercising it: an item reaches a wound when the item's treatable half of its healing
/// spec (W0's <see cref="HealingComponent.TreatedDamageTypes"/>) overlaps the wound's
/// <c>damageTypes</c>, the wound's <c>healingMultiplier</c> is above zero, and the item's
/// <see cref="TreatmentCapability"/> set overlaps that of some body-part profile listing the wound.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both halves matter. <c>damageTypes</c> alone decides nothing: <c>WolfmedTendonCutWound</c> carries
/// Slash so that a suture's spec resolves a part at all, and <c>healingMultiplier: 0</c> is what makes
/// the suture land nothing. A row of all-false items with a declared <see cref="Exit"/> is the normal
/// shape of a wound that only a procedure clears.
/// </para>
